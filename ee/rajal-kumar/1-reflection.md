1. Why is reflection important?

  Reflection is Important because, it give you a chance to go back and go through what you have been doing. For me personally I'm not the type of person who can read and sink in information the first time round. So I have to regularly come back and try to build a concept in my head and interpret things from an unorthodox point of view.

2. What did I do well this week?

  What I noticed my self doing better was how I took my time and looked over all my HTML codes, so in another sense I was reflecting as I was going along with everything. This was something I struggled at previously at University, I also learn't whats going on behind the sense of everything I do. These are for things such as GitHub, Atom etc.

3. What could I have done to improve?

  I feel like what I could have done would have been to take more time to read all the material before I got stuck into the bulk of the tasks.
