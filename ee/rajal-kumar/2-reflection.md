1. What did I do well this week?

    I was able to use GitHub a lot easier this week. I was able to go through the stage, commit and push method easy without having the headache of going back and fixing up the area when it came to the git push command. I also was able to spend more time going through my HTML and CSS and add more and tidy it up.

2. What could I have done to improve?

    I could have worked on my timing a bit more, this week I feel like I was a bit slower than the last. Also my CSS is a area where I need to spend more time with, by doing this would mean my skill sets with CSS will improve and also my blogs looks.
