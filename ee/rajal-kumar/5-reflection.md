What did I do well this week?

I felt like I improved my understanding of JavaScript a lot more. I was able to work at my own pace and focus on things I wasn't too sure of.  

What could I have done to improve?

Like previous weeks I really need to pick my self up more and figure out a better technique to get me through the material a bit faster.
