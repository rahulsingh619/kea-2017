What did I do well this week?

I felt like I improved the way used CSS this week. I have always felt like this was a weak spot for me, now I shall work on it further.

What could I have done to improve?

I really feel like I could have spent more time on this weeks sprint. I was slowed down due to external events, from now on I wish to step up my game even further as I'm getting into the groove of programming.
