1. What did I do well this week?

    I felt like this week I took my time understanding the basic concepts a lot for JavaScript, and spent less time trying to memorize the syntax. Although I did look over them well.

2. What could I have done to improve?

    I know I need to improve my timing/pace. Focus on getting through topics a bit quicker.
