Reflection

Reflection is important as it makes us think about what you have done and the experience you gained.

2nd week

I did well this week by not quiting... again. I had some horific issues with my compuiter but managerd to stick it out..

Switching over my operating system to Linux was like a new start in a lot of ways. Was like a revision exercise, getting all the tools, links and repositories up and running... again.

My blog got a nice overhaul and is looking basic but tidy. Want to get some sort of background and a navigation bar going next week.


What to Improve?

Stop going down the rabit hole! Although, focused repetitive learning suits me and I do have time up my sleeve as no other committments other than a bit of basketball coaching.

Have a go... move forward... there is always [ctrl z]... advice I have been giving people for years.

Over and out for another 8day week (as I seem to need monday to finish last weeks sprint)
