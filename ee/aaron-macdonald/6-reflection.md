This week I really enjoyed getting over the humps while coding the minesweeper game, as you see something go from not-working to working.

To improve my efficiency and wellbeing I need to do do an overview of my processes for:
  - coding
  - checking syntax
  - issue resolution

I intend to do this before starting the week 7 assignments as it well put me in a good place going forward.
