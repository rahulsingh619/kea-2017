#What did I do well this week?

- I managed to get all the majority of the work done this week and had a weekend off.
- I got to know my cohort better and have some social time.
- Better time boxing.
- Asked help for when I needed it.
- Helped people out.

#What could I have done to improve?

- Need more confidence that I am doing well.
- Again I need to learn to keep the horrible judging voice in my head down!
- Forgot to track my time again.
