What did I do well this week?

Helped my cohort and got through my work. Feeling more confident as
I went though my work. I was able to get more a regular routine going. I am
able to work longer. Working with people makes the learning proses more easier.   


What could I have done to improve?

I need to trust in myself more and look after my self. I did not get enough
sleep which made my anxiety worse.

I need to learn to keep the horrible judging voice in my head down!
