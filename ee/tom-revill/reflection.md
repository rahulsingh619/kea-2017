What did I do well this week?

I am  very happy I could get up and back into a regular routine as I have not
been able to do this in the last couple of weeks. I am very happy that I was able
to help people in my group as this has made me feel like I am a part of something
good and kind.

In addition to all the above the above relearning GIT has been an absolute joy
as I love the command line is such a lovely experience.             

What could I have done to improve?

I could improve my reading ability and understanding about the various mind sets
that I am being introduced by EDA.
I need to try and work on my getting in to a better life work balance as this is
crucial to my future.

My anxiety is still my biggest issues as it holds me back and hurts me. I need
to be kinder to myself.
