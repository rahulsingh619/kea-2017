What did I do well this week?

I am very happy that I achieved a working responsive website.
Also happy to that I was able to hone my CSS skills.   


What could I have done to improve?

Time boxing is still a challenge and remember to put my timer on for my work.
Typing is till a challenge but I will get there.
