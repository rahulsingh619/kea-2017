Week 7

Q: What did I do well this week?
Q: What could I have done to improve?q

Re:
  I realised that despite the training being so intensive and sometimes even frustrating, it is still less stressful than my previous job done for 8yrs, and definitely it is more fun :-) I also noticed that in fact, I am learning JS for the last 3 weeks only and I am already able to do basic algorithms by my own and I do really enjoy it.
Re:
  I could timebox better, I do need more time for learning than I really have and it's difficult to manage the time efficiently.
