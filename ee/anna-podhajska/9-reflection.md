What did I do well through my nine weeks in Phase 0?
What could I have done to improve through my nine weeks in Phase 0?

 I learned a lot of new things that I would have never thought is possible to learn during such short time. I did my best during phase 0 and I think I did well : -)

 Better time management, less refactoring, more process over product, exercise and rest better.
