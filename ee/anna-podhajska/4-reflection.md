What did I do well this week?
What could I have done to improve?

this will be "I" series : -)

I was able to finally start learning JS and forget about the website's new features and learning css media-queries..

I was able to plan the current sprint's blog design that adjusts to screen size, then do it quickly, add text and leave without re-factoring. I did not spend more than 45 min on it.

I focused on the Free Code Camp, actually still finishing it. I am doing it slowly, take notes and really learn, understand to memorize, as instead running just to pass.

I can still improve typing by using less old habits and using the right fingers. Also, there is still a bunch of materials that I had no time to read.
