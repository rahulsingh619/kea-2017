What did I do well this week?
What could I have done to improve?

I like my new blog page. I learned more about skeleton.
I could read more sprint overview information, which are useful but sometimes I just rush with the tasks and don't spend enough time on learning from the materials provided. I also need to make more breaks from the desk, will use pomodoro technique to achieve this next week.
