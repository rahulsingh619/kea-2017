 What did I do well this week?
 This week I was much more confident using the command terminal and editing html. I also learned how to tidy and fix errors in html.

 What could I have done to improve?
 I could of read through the assignment layout and the resources another time to get a better understanding, which would of helped when I got stuck in places.
