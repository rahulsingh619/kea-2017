I've reflected on this past week and have decided that even though I didn't finish on-time I am more prepared for the next week because I did the basics over and over again to drill myself.  At the end of the day a good foundation is always better than a rush  project.

I think I managed to get more accomplished than what meets the eye.  I learned so many tricks to save time that in the long run I should be able to code faster.

I did get a little stressed this week thinking that I am going to be the only sucker that didn't finish on-time.  I started to doubt if  I made the right decision to do such a fast-tracked course.  I like to plan and get systems in place.  Systems are the key to being productive in my mind.  I need to quit thinking this is a race to see who finishes first and focus on the basics.   Since typing is the key skill I believe I should focus on command codes versus word speed.  I should also wash my car because it's really dirty (smile).
