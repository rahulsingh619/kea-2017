What did I do well this week?

This week I was able to focus a little better when I had the time.  Time was not really available most of the week so I had to do 8 hour to 12 hour days to catch up.  That being said I was pleased that I at least got the work done even though it was late.

What could I have done to improve?

Not much I could have done to improve due to time constraints.  If I could add a few hours a day to the clock to get things done I would, but personal and business obligations required my immediate attention.
