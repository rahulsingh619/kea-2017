## What I did well this week
I manage to keep my personal commits in line to not completely dictate my EDA work. I also had a chance to put my creative hat on and thought through some ideas for my website. I have manage to pop into slack occasionally to spread optimism (everyone is doing so well it is hard not to be optimistic!), encourage, and collaborate with others. Best of all, I've manage to built a habit to show up at Lower Hutt market on Sat for fruit and veges for the week ahead and cooked enough for lunch this week. 

The hours spent on the Search Inside Yourself book has been the most worthwhile this week. Lots of theory but they all seems to make sense. I was an unhappy person by default, much like the author and I've grown into someone who is optimistic of a better tomorrow, and hope to remain that way for the rest of my life. 

## What I could improve on
I will try to breaking the week's work up, into reading, designing and actual coding. There is never enough time, but I should able to squeeze more out of the day by chaining together the little fragments of time together.
I will continue to do typing exercises daily, acutally twice a day, once in the morning and once after lunch before the afternoon rampage begins.
