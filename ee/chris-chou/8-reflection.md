## What did I do well this week
Really spent time on helping others achieve their goals. Some time these felt more important than completing my own work. 
I created a plan for my typing. I'm currently fairly consistent around 50wpm, and hoping to improve that to 60wpm before boot camp starts
Bringing last week's experience in pairing to this week, I tried explaining more of what I plan to do, am doing, and won't do (and why) instead of just asking for it to be done.

## What you could've done to improve 
I slipped a bit on my effort to get to EDA on time at 8:45am, only doing that for 2 of the 5 days in last week. I should further stick to the bus schedule to enable me to consistently make the 8:45am time to EDA.
