## What I did well this week
I caught up on EDA course work. I made my first honest attempt ever at designing a webpage, for my github portfolio site. It was so much fun I was quite carried away and ended up with something quite different to my paper based design. There is some frustration with building my site, HTML and CSS are still quite foreign to me. I did manage to get very close to what I want, without too much compromise. 
I made a conscious decision to break bad typing habits which stagnate my typing performance at about 50 wpm. It wasn't an easy decision as I know it will at least half my typing speed in the short term and I've a lot of work to do. But I don't think I can get to the typing speed I need to survive (at least 80, ideally 120 wpm) long term.

## What I could improve on
Typing! 
Practice mindfulness, it should really just happen whenever I don't need to focus or concentrate on something.
Pushing the boundary of what can be done in HTML and CSS, without any JS.
I also would like to help others as much as possible through slack, email, in person.
As always nodejs runtime is high on the list of things to learn
