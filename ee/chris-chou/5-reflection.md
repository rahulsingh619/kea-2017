## What did I do well this week
I manage to start the beginning of the week on tasks left over from last week and completed this week's work by Friday, in time to kick off my long weekend!
I spent time chatting to other cohort members, as well as people outside my cohort and understand a bit about their aspirtions and experiences and I practice mindful listening and dipping proactively.

## What you could've done to improve 
My typinig speed took a major hit trying to get used to the proper habit, but I know this is necessary pain in order to be successful. I'm glad I took a step back from typing exercise every now and then and just learn to flow on the keyboard a bit and not get too bogged down with the actual WPM.
