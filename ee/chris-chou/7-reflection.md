## What did I do well this week
I am proud of the work I did with Mike in our pair programming of the Maori proverb page. I felt both of us have brought our strength to the table and we had a common purpose (to build a great looking and functional page that showcases our mastery of the web technologies). It is the first pair programming session I had in years and contrary to some of hte comments I received I don't know Javascript well, most of the work done was learnt on the day. My ability to learn quickly is what I fall back on and I'm glad that I haven't "lost it" not being in the development industry all these years. 


## What you could've done to improve 
I could do better at verbalising my goals, thoughts and my expectations. During the pairing sessions, I sometime ended up more directing than navigating. Granted some of it is syntax errors I pick up, but many times I wasn't able to explain myself enough and resort to just giving low level edit instructions to compensate.
