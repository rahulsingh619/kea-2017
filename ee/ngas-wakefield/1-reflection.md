Why is reflection important?
So you can see what you have learned so far and see where you need to improve on.

 What did I do well this week?
 On the first day I never knew how to use github, powershell or atom. Now I have a basic understanding to get the projects done.

 What could I have done to improve?
 Stick to one assignment instead of working on multiple projects, so I can keep up with what I have done and what I need to do.
