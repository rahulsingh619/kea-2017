What did I do well this week?
Well I created a whole JS page which calls out to an API. It turned out to be a pretty neat page. There is lots of hidden js such as functions called by other functions,
i have hidden and shown elements, and i have incorporated changing backgrounds. I am happy with my progress that I have made over the corse of this 9 weeks.

What could I have done to improve?
When I was going through the checklist there were a few things that I still am not totally sure I understand.
