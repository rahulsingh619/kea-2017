What did I do well this week?
This week was very hard for me and I fell behind early. I started working on a responsive site that
was not skeleton based and instead doing it all by hand. This gave me a better understanding of what needed to be
added to a site to make it responsive without using skeleton. I also used my cohort when i was needed a pep talk, they
were very supportive and helped me through my issues.  I recognized that I needed sometime to recharge my batteries,
and I gave that time to myself.



What can I improve on.
I  needed a break this week I had been going hard and I think this caused me to hit a wall.
I took some needed R and R, but I might have indulged to much. I could have spent a bit more time in the evenings.
I would like to improve on reading the weeks tasks better so I understanding the goals of the week.
