What did I do well this week?
I took a lot of time for myself this week. Just gave myself a break. It was helpful in being able to destress.
With the calculator assignment I found i wrote small efficient functions. The calculator was a good project because
push our boundaries as developers.


What could I have done to improve?
I need to be practicing my typing more. I should be doing more typing tests. It really has improved and I am
very happy for that.
