What did I do well this week?
I worked very hard this week. Took lots of notes and went over lots of JS challenges.
I wrote a good tech blog that was understandable to ppl and I was able to have lunch with a classmate.


What can I improve on.
I think my way of learning is not the best and I need to change it. My note taking is good for memory recall but
not good for code recall I think.
