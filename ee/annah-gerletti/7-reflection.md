What did I do well this week?
I worked welling when I paired program. I felt I was very understanding and proved good feedback at the end of the session.
I also did really well at turning on the toggle timer. I went back through the variable section on Free Code Camp. I did much better than the first time.  

What could I have done to improve?
I would like to have more time to practice pair programing, I felt I need to work with more people. I feel that i still
have many tickets to complete. I spent a lot of time early in the week going over concepts. Next week I would like to
accomplish more easier in the week.
