What did I do well this week?
I was able to finish all parts of the sprint this week. There were some challenges that I did really well on and it made me feel very good. I am excited about creating a game next week.

 What could I have done to improve?
 My typing needs to improve, I do well when I am typing whats in my head not what I am reading. I also am having trouble typing symbols like tags and quotes. I take so many notes and I need to review them more often.
