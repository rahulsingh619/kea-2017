What did I do well this week?
I was able to accomplish all the work. This was a very packed week, i spent many more hours working on these assignments. I learned a lot but there is a lot I still need to practice.

What could I have done to improve?
I could have reviewed my notes more. Spent more time on the Udacity videos. I was updating my webpage but I was not incorporating new elements into the blog posts. I need to work on flexiboxs more and incorporating elements as I learn them.
