What did I do well this week?
I completed the minesweeper game and produced something pretty cool. It was very hard for me in the long run.
I needed lots of help and guidance to get through it. I finished my work early and had the weekend to work on some
personal projects. I realized I needed so me time this week, it was good that I understood I needed a break.


What could I have done to improve?
I could have sought out comfort from my cohort to see how they were fairing with the assignment. Finding out that my class were all struggling with the minesweeper assignment really put my feelings in perspective. I think my note taking still needs to improve I am going to try and write electronic notes in atom.
