What did I do well this week?

Actually I didn't very well this week. I didn't boxed time in my assignments, then
I put much time in some of them and not enough in others. Which made me behind and couldn't
finish the assignments by Friday as I had planned.

 What could I have done to improve?
 Well manage my time.
