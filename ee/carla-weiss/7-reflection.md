What did I do well this week?
I worked in pair, which is something that I have always enjoyed and we could completed
the assignment very well figured out new functions, it was a very good job and I'm glad I did it.
It was a long time without working in a team spirit.


 What could I have done to improve?
 I could have time boxed my time better.
