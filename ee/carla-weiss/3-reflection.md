What did I do well this week?
I have time boxed almost all my tasks, I've been planning be able to finish all the study by Friday and this is the first week I've made it and I'm really glad with all my work of this week.
 What could I have done to improve?
 I definitely don't like the meditation thing and I have to read about it to make on of my blogs, I'm just pushing this read forward but at the end I'll do it, so I just should have done this already so I would stop worry about it.
