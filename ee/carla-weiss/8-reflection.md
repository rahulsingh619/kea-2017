What did I do well this week?

I took time for myself, I didn't work well as the other weeks, but I was in need to calm myself, so I did it.

 What could I have done to improve?

 Maybe I could tried harder and finish the assignments by Sunday, but I don't think that I would be able to do any improvements
  working as stressed as I was.
