 - What did I do well this week?
I am glad with myself improvement, I was able to do most of the tasks all by
myself and I've been had a great relationship with my cohort. I am well
managing my study time... But I feel I still have to make it better.

 -  What could I have done to improve?
 I need to improve how I manage my time to study enough on weekdays to be able
 to finish all tasks by Friday night.
