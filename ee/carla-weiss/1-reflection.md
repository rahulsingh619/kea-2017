
Why is reflection important?
Is important because we need to know what we are doing, why we are doing it
and if we are doing it correctly. So we have to stop and think then we can go
ahead and make things with a clear and healthy brain.

 What did I do well this week?
 I dedicated myself to be a full time student, I planned to focus on my
 assignments and I did it. I'm easy to be distracted and I was able to be really
 focused, it made me glad!

 What could I have done to improve?
 I could have use more time in my studies and finished everything already, but I
 had a few unexpected things going on and it took my time away.
