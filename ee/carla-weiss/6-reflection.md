What did I do well this week?
I've put more time in my assignments and I'll be able to finish all in the time I wanted.
For then take the weekend to study about JS.

 What could I have done to improve?
 If I've had good knowledge about JS I'd be better doing the assignments, but I don't have this necessary knowledge so I couldn't improve at all
 even doing all the assignments about JS.
