What did I do well this week?
I was more prepared at the begining of the week that normal. I had gone through more of the early material than previously that set me up for success.
What could I have done to improve?
I for myself to be exhausted on Wednesday, and took the whole day off. This in turn gave me the energy to get on with the work at hand, and the energy to finish the Sprint the next week.
