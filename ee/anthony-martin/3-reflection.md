What did I do well this week?
I kept going every day, no matter how difficult the task was I persisted in completing the work.

What could I have done to improve?
My time management skill are really lacking. Last week has now set me back and I will need to find time to bring the scope of work forward considerably. Were I will be able to find the time at is cause for concern.
