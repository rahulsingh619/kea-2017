What did I do well this week?
Some how I managed to get more done than I thought that I could. Personally I was quite overwhelmed but I stayed calm and soldiered on and did the best that I could.
What could I have done to improve?
My time management was quite poor attacking problems in the middle of the night rather that in the morning, this in turn gave me a lot of fatigue that lead into more tiredness the following day. Not smart, I hope to be more proactive and sleep more and do more work in the morning.
