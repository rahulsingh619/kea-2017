Reflection is important tool as it allows us to use hindsight to think about situations in our lives and how we could have done anything differently. This allows room for personal growth. Reflection is also important as it helps to cement things that we are learning.

This week I felt I adjusted to the timetable and schedule of being a student again rather well. I was able to meet some of my classmates and work through the coursework together, something that I believe helps both parties involved.

This week I could have tried harder at giving more hours to coursework. I think as I get more used to study, I will be able to commit more time to it.
