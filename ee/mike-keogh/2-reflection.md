Reflections:

This week I feel i did well in not letting the thought of the work ahead of me overwhelm me, and instead focused on the task at hand. I tried to tackle the assignments a bit too early in the week i think and i had to go back over some of the content.

This week i could have improved by spending more time on lots of different things as opposed to time on one thing. I need to work on timeboxing work and using toggl better to record my hours. I could also be going over work better both in terms of reflection and in reiterating material.
