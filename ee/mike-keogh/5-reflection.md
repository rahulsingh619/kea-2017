This week i feel that I managed to implement practises for dealing with stress and
problem solving well. I had a few problems that my cohort helped with after i could
not trouble shoot them myself. I am enjoying learning javascript and am trying to
remind myself that it will take time to master the many tools it has to offer.

I could have done better this week by doing a little bit more study outside of the course work to
try and understand javascript more. Time is one of the larger constraints on me
achieving that and I know I can make time so I need to work on that part.
