This week I feel that i was able to focus more on the process than the product,
where as in past weeks i was focusing too much on creating a product than a
process. As a result i was not able to complete some parts of my website due to
time restrictions. As a result I feel I could have used some of my time better this
week, and learn to integrate what we learned in the first few weeks into thecurrent
weeks assignments. I also need to timebox better, and not worry about the end product!
