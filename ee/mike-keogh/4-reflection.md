This week I managed to practise some very amateur meditation during my jaunt with
javascript. I feel that I persisted through problems and accepted when I needed to
ask for help. I have a habit of wanting to be good at things straight away but I
also know that to get good at something I need to practice it. I am at that stage
where I know that I will get better at JS but it will take time.

I did not manage my time very well towards the end of the week, and was feeling
a bit beat up at the end of each day sitting in front of the computer for so long.
I found that talking walks and attempting to breath mindfully were helpful. Next week
I want to try and take more opportunities to practice those techniques.
