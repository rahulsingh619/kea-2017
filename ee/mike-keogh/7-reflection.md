This week I feel that I persevered well. If there is one thing I have learned
so far from this course it is how to persevere. I have felt during this course
many times that I am in over my head but then seem to emerge with new understanding
of my self and what I can achieve. I could have used my timebox strategies better this week
and also could have spent more time re iterating over past weeks materials as some of it
is getting hazy.
