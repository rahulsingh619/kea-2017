Over the course of phase zero, I feel that I was able to do well by attempting to learn something new and foreign. Out of the habits, I feel that I was able to persevere, reflect, communicate, hone explore and play. I feel that these habits were somewhat synonymous with who I am. I feel like I need to work on the other habits. I tried to implement all of the habits into my work, but I feel realistically that I need to work more on the habits of tidying, equinimity and sharing. I need to work on my tidying more than just the indentation and presentation of the code but also with my blog and upkeep of my blog. I have attempted to work on equinimity but I could have worked harder on balancing my emotion. I need to also work on sharing my work, and being proud of what I have made, as opposed to being a perfectionist and thinking that work I have produced early in my progression is not worthy of sharing. I will work on these habits over the course of my bootcamp and also after.
